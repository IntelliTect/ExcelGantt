# Excel Gantt Chart    
Compare schedules with an automatic gantt chart in Excel. 

We had a project where we needed to compare dates in for two schedule options. The lists of dates were in emails and it was really hard to see the differences.

I put the dates side by side and then realized that it was still hard to comprehend the differences. 

Using some formulas I was able to build a quick little gantt chart. I cringed while I built it, but it turned out that it really helped people visualize things. I am sure this could be done better with other tools, but for a 30 minute solution, the worked really well. 

A few notes
   1. The dates for the gantt chart start in J3 and continue to the right.
   2. The date in J2 and to the right are done manually.
   3. The left dates will be represented by a - on the gantt chart.
   4. The right dates will be represented by an = on the gantt chart.
   5. If they overlay, a + is shown.
   6. If the dates are the same on the left, they are shown in blue.
